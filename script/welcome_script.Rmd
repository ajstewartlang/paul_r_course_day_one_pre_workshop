# Welcome

Welcome everyone to my R Course for the Open University. There is a little bit of preparation work I'd like you to do in advance. Before the course itself I'd like you to watch the videos below and install R and RStudio Desktop. R is the programming language, and RStudio Desktop is the interface we use to interact with the language. It's important that you have working installations of R and RStudio Desktop on your computers before the course starts, so if you have any trouble getting those two things up and running please let me know in advance. You can contact me via [email](mailto:drandrewjstewart@gmail.com) or direct message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ajstewart_lang).

First off, have a look at this video about the course.

## Why R?

Both R and RStudio Desktop are examples of [Open Source Software](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source). Open Source is key to producing reproducible research as Open Source software is free and available to all.

In the video below, I'll introduce you to R and talk about the importance of adopting such tools in our research analysis workflows.

## Getting Started

Before the course, please install R (the language) and RStudio Desktop (the interface that helps us interact with R) - each is available for MacOS, Windows, and Linux. The Mac version of R can be installed from [here](https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/bin/macosx/R-4.0.5.pkg) and the Windows version from [here](https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/bin/windows/base/R-4.0.5-win.exe).

The Mac version of RStudio Desktop can be installed from [here](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/macos/RStudio-1.4.1106.dmg) and the Windows version from [here](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/windows/RStudio-1.4.1106.exe).

If you any problems with either of the above, you can select a different version of R to download from [here](https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/) and a different version of RStudio Desktop from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

If you are using a Chromebook, or have a tablet, or are having difficulties installing R and RStudio Desktop on your computer, you can use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) to run the RStudio environment in your browser. You'll need to sign up - there is a free plan available which allows you to use the RStudio Cloud for 15 hours per month.

## Installing Packages

When you first instal R, you'll see it comes with only a small number of packages. Much of the data wrangling/visualisation/modeling that we'll be doing on this course requires the use of additional packages. In this video I'll show you how to install the ones that we'll need to use.

## On The Day

Both days will be run via Zoom. Make sure you install the [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download) beforehand.

I'll circulate the Zoom details beforehand.

## Technical Details
All of the material in this workshop was created using open source where possible. I used a [Lenovo ThinkPad X13](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/ThinkPad-X13-Intel-/p/22TPX13X3N1) running [GNU/Linux distro Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/). The audio was captured with a [Fifine USB Podcasting microphone](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Condenser-Microphone-Recording-Interface-Power-K669/dp/B01N034RTC/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=141Z8ED4VGCVD&dchild=1&keywords=fifine+usb+podcast+condenser+microphone&qid=1594989611&sprefix=fifne+usb%2Caps%2C162&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFFMzAxOE5DUDJIREwmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA4MzA2NjIxVU40MlhNMFNCTDhWJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA5NDI2OTQxOFY0R002UVJBS1AzJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) and the video with a [Razer Kiyo webcam](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Razer-Streaming-Adjustable-Brightness-Microphone/dp/B076QK6489/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=razer+kiyo&qid=1594989677&sr=8-3). The audio and video were recorded using [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) and edited using [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/). The R code was written using [R 4.0.5](https://www.r-project.org/), and run in [RStudio Desktop IDE](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) version 1.4.1106.

The structure for this course was very much inspired by the [Sharing At Short Notice](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/sharing-on-short-notice-how-to-get-your-materials-online-with-r-markdown/) webinar by Alison Hill and Desir√©e De Leon.
